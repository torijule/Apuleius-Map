				<h1>Landscape facilitating The Ancient Novel</h1>
				
				<p>In Apuleiusâ€™s Metamorphosis, landscape is a prominent theme throughout the course of the novel as the characters move around 
					the ancient landscape in both a horizontal and vertical axis.  In reading the ancient novel I became interested in how the 
					characters interacted with their landscape and ultimately how landscape seemed to facilitate the story and stories, 
					myths and legends in general.  </p>
					
					<p> At the beginning of the novel, the narrator gives a lengthy description of his background and tours the reader around the 
					entire Mediterranean landscape.  Slater noticed that within the first section of this work there are a total 118 words that are 
					or are derived from place names which completely obliterates any notion of a geographic imagination (Harrison, 2009; Slater, 2002).
					This hugely contrasts with Lucius as a man, who prefers to describe the features of a  landscape than actually locate it, 
					and especially that of Lucius as a donkey who opts to describe the roads and his physical reactions to the harsh landscapes 
					but is uninterested in giving them a specific location (Montiglio, 2007; Harrison, 2009).  Most of the place names that Lucius
					does name come from stories he overhears, which take on their own landscapes and themes that parallel the main storyline.  
					Just as Apuleius overwhelms his reader with geographic specificity at the beginning of the novel, I have fixed a map of the world 
					to the left of this page, where the user is forced to consider the actual and physical dimensions of the landscape 
					as a static fact, while I argue that landscape in stories parallels plots and themes because perception of landscape is inherently subjective.</p>
