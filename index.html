				<h1>Landscape facilitating The Ancient Novel</h1>
				
				<p>In Apuleiusâ€™s Metamorphosis, landscape is a prominent theme throughout the course of the novel as the characters move around 
					the ancient landscape in both a horizontal and vertical axis.  In reading the ancient novel I became interested in how the 
					characters interacted with their landscape and ultimately how landscape seemed to facilitate the story and stories, 
					myths and legends in general.  </p>
					
					<p> At the beginning of the novel, the narrator gives a lengthy description of his background and tours the reader around the 
					entire Mediterranean landscape.  Slater noticed that within the first section of this work there are a total 118 words that are 
					or are derived from place names which completely obliterates any notion of a geographic imagination (Harrison, 2009; Slater, 2002; Miller, 1981).
					This hugely contrasts with Lucius as a man, who prefers to describe the features of a  landscape than actually locate it, 
					and especially that of Lucius as a donkey who opts to describe the roads and his physical reactions to the harsh landscapes 
					but is uninterested in giving them a specific location (Montiglio, 2007; Harrison, 2009).  Most of the place names that Lucius
					does name come from stories he overhears, which take on their own landscapes and themes that parallel the main storyline.  
					Just as Apuleius overwhelms his reader with geographic specificity at the beginning of the novel, I have fixed a map of the world 
					to the left of this page, where the user is forced to consider the actual and physical dimensions of the landscape 
					as a static fact, while I argue that landscape in stories parallels plots and themes because perception of landscape is inherently subjective.</p>
					
					<h2 id="key">Key</h2>
					<p>Markers on this map indicate places that were actually travelled to or from during any storyline of Apuleius's Metamorphosis.  Blue markers indicate the
					places mentioned in the main storyline of Lucius.  Green are places from stories Lucius is told or overhears.  Purple indicates a location from both the storyline of 
					Lucius and a literary topography. </p>

					<h2 id="type">Types of Landscapes and Roads </h2>
					
					<p>If you zoom into the map, you can see the topography layer, which shows the variation in the landscape.
						At the same time, these are the following ways that Lucius understands the geography and geology 
						around him within the novel. </p>
									
					<h2 id="plot">Plot and Narrative </h2>
						<h3>Topography </h3>
						<p> There seem to be two primary types of landscapes in the novel, rugged mountainous and peaceful rolling hills.
						The steep and rocky topography serves metaphorically as a place of suffering and danger.  These treacherous locales are places
						that physically wear on the body to traverse, occupied by people may attack you with rocks along the path unprovoked (4.72, 8.17, 9.4), 
						contain quaint cliffs suitable for throwing people off the mountain (4.5, 4.12, 5.27), and provide shelter for thieves (4.6, 6.25) (Zimmerman, 2002).  
						puleius also talks of the mountainous landscape in the same way that he describesthe physical ails of the body and of magic.  This contrasts starkly
						peaceful countryside, which does not get mentioned nearly as often. Perhaps this is similar to had someone walked around the region and written up reviews of the 
						places and trails - most people who write a review do so to complain.  Certainly we see this sort of contradiction in 6.25-6.28, where Lucius complains about the rocky road on the way to the robber's hide out 
						the entire way there, but has no complaints about the path when he is escaping.  The happy meadow landscape instead is associated with peaceful music correlating with Strabo's accounts of 
						musical tradition, which implies a specific locale, scenic oceans or springs, and the resolution of arrival (10.1, 10.18, 11) These landscapes alternate, paralleling the trials of the Lucius. </p>
						<h3>Paths </h3>
						<p>Each of these landscapes contain paths which are a more granular representation of progressive development throughout the story, how landscape is immediately experienced as it is being traversed,
						and landscapes within landscapes. I found three different kinds of paths: steep, slippery and easy paths to traverse.  The steep and easy paths are nearly identical in character and function as the steep and serene landscapes
						described above.  The slippery landscapes add another dimension of peril for both the phyical and spiritual being. For example, in 9.9 we see a slippey path that is just as difficult for Lucius as an ass to move through as the rocky landscape
						as it also symbolizes the illusion and deceitfulness of the false priests (Zimmerman, 2002).</p>
						<h3>Chicken or the Egg: Landscape or Theme </h3>
						<p>Why do bad things always seem to happen in barren landscapes, or at the top of a sharp, rocky cliff?  Why do we today still associate an eerie background music, to a steep cliff, to anticipate something forthcoming, while we would sooner place 
						a peaceful scene in a quiet meadow.  This is evident throughout modern films and games that create comtemportary or alternative landscapes and cultures, just as we see it in the Ancient World throughout different cultures (Lane, 1998).  
						Perhaps it could be a testiment to a shared human experience or perception of these landscapes?  Or a testiment to their resources?  The best explination for this riddle is that landscape, especially throughout a narrative, is subjective.</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="subj">Subjectivity of Landscape </h2>
					<p> Since so little of our geographic and geologic knowledge of the landscape comes from explicit locales, we must also consider the themes present when Apuleius discusses the landscape qualitatively or uses geologic terminology.  The following are a list of themes I noticed
					that support the subjectivity of landscape both in general and through the eyes of our narrator.</p>
						<h3> False Landscapes/Mirages </h3>
						<p>At the beginning of book two, Lucius gives us a narrative describing the landscape of Hypata.  He states that the rocks look as though they might have been hardened people and that
						nothing seemed to be what it actually was.  This implies that landscape is not fixed, but instead it is fluid and malleable.  The landscape can be changed perhaps in a more rapid and dynamic 
						way than would be expected on a geological scale.  He attributes mistrust of the landscape to magic, however he introduces the notion that landscape can be decieving.  This theme of turning into
						landscape is repeated a few times throughout the novel, in 2.5 Lucius is warned of witches doing just this.  In fact the notion of animal and landscape seem to be connected.  When Lucius is turned into 
						an ass, Harrison noted that the term 'duratur' is used, a word with geologic orgins, and from within the animal skin, Lucius describes his hide to contain a pit from lashes (2009). Another examples of this is in 6.14, Psyche also fears becoming part of the landscape. </p>
						Finally, there are many instances in the novel where landscape appears to be one thing, but indeed winds up becoming another; paths that look safe and turn out dangerous, mistaking an oasis of roses for oleanders. 
						<h3> Fantasy Landscapes and Literary Topography </h3>
						<p>Apuleius uses fantasy landscapes as a means of communicating topographic character and/or specific locale throughout the main storylines of the novel, as well as stories that Lucius overhears.  
						Many landscapes are borrowed from epics or legend.  Lucius's wanderings parallel those of Odysseus and both have similar experiences crossing over the landscape in their wanderings, for example Odysseus's encounter with the Laestrygonians is similar to Lucius's in 8.17 (Koing, 2013).
						While being trapped in the cave, Lucius overhears the stories of the robber's deaths which parallel in theme and landscape the topographies from the epics on the Pelponnesian War and 7 Against Thebes (Harrison, 2009).  If we relate a body to be like a landscape in that it has a changing topography 
						and especially in the case of Lucius also be not what it seems, the projection of a landscape may also serve as a fantasy landscape. </p>
						<p>It is evident that most of the places that are referenced in the novel come from fantasy landscapes as literary topography. It is possible that this is stylistic (Millar, 1981). This may be a testiment to Lucius's character, too curious about wandering and chasing the next mystery to focus on an exact location.  Later in the book, it may also be a manifestation of Lucius as an ass,
						because an animal might not have the care or concentration to note distinctive marks along the landsape to specify locale, but would pay more attention to its own present physical relation to/consequences of the landscape.  It may be that the only time Apuleius felt such attention to geography was appropriate is when another character, such as the narration at the opening of the novel or a robber who by trade would need to be 
						concerned with places to plunder and trade.  In each case, the narrator has a distinctly different relationship to the landscape and how it is being leveraged within their storyline.  I suspect that this is why we get such different styles and granularity of talking about the landscape throughout the Metamorphoses. Even as Lucius changes, becoming part of the cult of Isis, the steep landscapes earlier described transition into scenic ocean views.</p>
						<h3> Artifical Landscapes </h3>
						<p>Finally, at the end of the novel, we see Lucius noticing not only that things may not be as they seem, but also recognizing artifical landscapes. One interpretation of this by Harrison is that he gains this greater understanding and knowledge from Isis, which includes that of the landscape.  One example of this is in 10.30, where Lucius notes the wooden mountain (2009).  This would correspond with
						the theme we have focused on in class, that ancient perception of the landscape was intrinsically connected to magic and the underworld.  Throughout the novel, malignant magic tends to happen in these high dangerous places, contrasted to the caves and valleys, which are placed just underneath in the same geologic structure, possibly with an oasis or pit that also may have magical properties to go all the way down to the underworld.
						Konig argues that being able to distinguish false landscapes as more than how Lucius physically endures is only made possible by his initation into the cult of Isis and places greater emphasis on the theme of the false perception of landscape (2013).</p>
						
					<h2 id="making">Making  the Map </h2>
					<p> The map was generated using Google Maps API along with tiles and coordinate data from the Pelagios project.
					While reading selections from Apuleius's Metamorphosis in both Latin and English, I kept a record of place names, types of topography and themes.  The Pelagios dataset
					was queried for these places and the first result that was returned was used for GPS coordinates.  This was done manually, while the search function of Pelagios API is 
					being worked on.  The Pelagios API will return an array of JSON objects, and when there is functionality in this map to pull coordinate data based on place name, I plan to use the 
					JSON/AJAX code that has been commented out to automatically pull real-time data from Pelagios.</p>
